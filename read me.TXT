To mass process images you must have a folder with loads of images taken in the right order in set of four.
Process that folder with picture_sort, 

it will generate a folder with sub folders corresponding to the different shots.

-run the picture2matrix python program and select the file with the sorted pictures
-run the matlab batch_processing (either hough or eigen): it will require you to select the matrix folder wich will have been saved in the same folder as 
all the picture batches. 
/!\ 
the last program will save all the pictures, change the directory (where the picture will be saved to) between batches or the pictures will 
be all mixed up
